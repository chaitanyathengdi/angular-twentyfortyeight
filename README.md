## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

** This is still a work in progress **

There are still a few things to work on:
- Subtle bugs
- New features (score tracking, undo, etc)
- Animated tiles

See the `notes.txt` file for details.
